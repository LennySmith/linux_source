# Introduction

This source code repository is one that I have been keeping on Git in my own paid for
repository. The remote command should give you the information on how it is stored, but
note that this is different than using Git on Visual Studio. I do things manually here,
using Git and SSH. So that will be different when / if other people get involved.
